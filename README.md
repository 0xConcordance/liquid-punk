# Liquify your OptiPunk
Note: use at own risk, smart contracts are unaudited. Moreover there is no use-case for oPunk. This is meant to be a personal project.

LiquidPunk hosted here: https://liquid-punk.vercel.app/

LiquidPunk allows you to turn your Optipunk into 100 ERC20 Tokens (oPUNK) and making it more tradable as a result. There are multiple use-cases for liquidPunk which I am going to outline here.
- Divisable
    - allowing investments of any size
    - allowing someone to get liquidity by only selling portions of an optiPunk
- Fungible 
    - making it easier to trade
- Permissionless NFT swaps 
    - mint 100 oPUNK -> redeem different optiPunk.
